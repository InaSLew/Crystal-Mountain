# Crystal Mountain

✏ This game was originally made between 13 - 17/09/2021 as a school project; later to be expanded into an endless runner.

✏ All the pixel art sprites and background image are made by me.

✏ Credits to pixelsphere.org, opengameart.org and CS50's Introduction to Game Development for the retro font, sound effects and music.
